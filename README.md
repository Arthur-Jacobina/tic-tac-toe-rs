# TIC TAC TOE Rust

## Intro

This is a simple fun project designed to test the minimax algorithm in Rust


## Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a popular game and its straightforward rules and manageable complexity make it a good starting point for exploring decision-making algorithms in games.

## How to run

1. Clone the repo
```(bash)
git clone https://github.com/Arthur-Jacobina/tic-tac-toe-rs.git
cd tic-tac-toe-ai
```

2. Build the project
```(bash)
cargo build
```

3. Run the game
```(bash)
cargo run
```

4. Modify main as you want
You can either play as a human or make Computer X Computer matches (I do not recommend it though haha)

## Minimax algorithm
The minimax algorithm in `player.rs` evaluates all possible moves recursively to maximize the AI's chances of winning while minimizing the opponent's chances.
